    "\n",
    "There are three key aims of this notebook:\n",
    "- Gain some understanding of the Folium plugin.\n",
    "- Deal with code that isn't behaving as expected.\n",
    "- Map some ship course data, including showing how we can convert data to multiple courses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we downloaded some data from Discovery while investigating how to use the Discovery API. Here, we are going to use the images we downloaded - the ships logs from the 1800's. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting imports\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing the libraries we will need. We are going to assume that you don't have the libraries installed, so we will install them as we go."

    "\n",
    "Prior to the GPS system, or other satellite navigation systems, ships navigated using dead reckoning. This is a method of navigation that uses the last known position of the ship, and the course and speed of the ship, to estimate the current position. This means the log recorded the course and speed of the ship, and the time at which the course and speed were recorded. "

    "## Ships logs and heading data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1800's, ships compasses were less accurate than modern 3-digit system compasses. As a consequence, they used a [32 wind compass rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_of_the_compass#32-wind_compass_rose). If we investigate the logs we've downloaded, they will contain headings such as \"ENE\" or \"NW\". These are about as accurate as ships could navigate at this point, and represent a range of headings of 11.25 degrees, which we will need to compensate for. \n",
    "Helpfully, we can make an assumption about these ranges, making the amount of data we need to generate more manageable. As we have to assume that the data in the log are accurate, we can assume that the ship was anywhere within the range of headings - for example, for ENE, this would be 78.75 to 90 degrees. The most likely was that the ship followed the middle of this course, but that they were not precise, and that the most out-of-course option is the limit of where they could be. So, we only need to generate 3 options - the most likely, and the two extremes. \n",
    "So, rather than generating 1 data point for each heading, we will generate 3. At the end of the course, this will give a range of positions that the ship could be in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sighting land\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique isn't perfect; once the ship sighted land, they would have been able to take an accurate location. In reality, this would have fixed any drift from the dead reckoning. However, we are aiming to keep this notebook understandable, so for now we are going to assume that the ship didn't sight land until the end of the journey. "

Luckily, the [geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library has a function that will do this for us - geodesic. This takes the start, bearing, and distance, and returns the lat and long of the end point.\n",

We know that Folium uses the JavaScript library (Leaflet)[], and searching the web for \"Leaflet TimeStampedGeoJson\" leads us to [this page](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/blob/main/folium/plugins/timestamped_geo_json.py) showing the code for the plugin. From here, at [line 77](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/blob/main/folium/plugins/timestamped_geo_json.py#L77), we can find our way to the original plugin code, [here](https://github.com/socib/Leaflet.TimeDimension). \n",
