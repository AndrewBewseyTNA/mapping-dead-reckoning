    "Now that we have a handle on using Folium and entering data from our own source, we are going to start looking at incorporating data from multiple locations to produce a richer map. We are going to look at a few different areas we can draw data from, and how we can incorporate them into our maps:\n",
    "- [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) files. In this case we will be looking at two things to do with coastlines:\n",
    "    - Whether our paths cross them\n",
    "    - Whether the ship is close enough to them to have made a sighting\n",

    "Simply Googling is an effective way to find access to GeoJson and shapefile data. Searching for a \"world map shapefile\", for example, is liley to lead you to [World Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0038272/World-Bank-Official-Boundaries) data. From here, we can find a link to a datasource called \"World coastlines\", which we should download. \n",

    "Note that, as with many types of data, some areas of the world are better covered than others. You may also find data behind a pay or register wall, or with other restrictions. There are, however, plently of data sources - feel free to have a go at searching for your own. For the examples in this notebook, we are going to be using the coastline data from World Bank. \n",

In this case, we are going to be using it to find the intersection between our path and the coastline. We can see the documentation for the intersection function [here](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.intersection.html). From this documentation, we can see that we need to pass in two shapes, and the funciton will return the coordiates where they intersect. As we don't actually care about the coordinates, we can just pass in the shapes and check if the result is empty or not."

In reality, when they sighted land, they could make an accurate fix to their location. Here, we are going look at how we can bring that data into our map.\n",

This is a reasonable assumption for a ship of the time, and is also a nice round number."
